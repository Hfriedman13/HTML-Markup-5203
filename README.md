# HTML-Markup-5203
Assignment 3 CPSC 5203
Instructions
Outcomes
The intent of this assignment is to build towards mastery of using HTML. Skills learned in this assignment will be built upon in assignment two, and are subject to examination. Upon successful completion of this assignment the student will be able to:

Articulate and implement the syntax of HTML markup.
Describe and apply semantic tags to create structural meaning.
Build a consistent navigation structure over multiple pages.
Articulate and implement the use of appropriate HTML attributes and tags.
Use absolute and relative links correctly.
Include at least one image in the webpage, addressing accessibility.
Submitting
Since your website will consist of multiple files ( 4 HTML pages and multiple images), start by putting everything into a folder named assign1_yourlogin (e.g., assign1_sealscd).  When confident it is ready, drag the entire folder to the Submit location.

Note: Since absolute links will only work on your computer, we recommend checking your submitted site to make sure all the links work as expected before signing off on your submission.  

You will lose marks if you do not follow these submission instructions.

Grading
Your assignment will be graded based on the overall layout of the pages, consistency between pages, as well as completion of the requirements on a per page basis.

Content Requirements
Each page on your site is intended to be a summary of a lecture in this course.. Lecture1.html, for instance, might capture our first lecture topics, which included:

a course summary, expectations, textbook
introduction of Seals
Description of the difference between WWW and Internet
The content for each lecture should be mostly correct, and does not need to be very long. Ideally, it will serve to remind you of the topics covered during the first 2 weeks of this course.

Functional Requirements
You must submit valid and semantically appropriate HTML5.

You must create at least 4 web pages that will define your "site". The pages must be named lecture1.html, lecture2.html, lecture3.html, and project.html. There is a page called lab1.html that you can use as a template for Lecture1 (summary), Lecture2 (summary), Lecture3(summary) and your 4th page is the implementation of one of the Hands-on Practice exercises in section 3.7.3 and the images will be provided).

Each of your pages must be consistent with one another. There should be:

a consistent layout look and feel between pages
(vertical) navigation menu with links between all 4 pages (using an unordered list)
Each of the pages must include:

The aforementioned menu that allows on to navigate between all the site's pages
At least one HTML comment per page
One unique photo (of your choosing) per page enclosed in a <figure>, with a <figurecaption> linking to where it was found.
Note: the clickable link to the source of the image should contain nothing more than the text source.

You must define "alt" and "title" attributes for all pictures.
Valid HTML5 markup. Your site should validate without error (warnings are ok).
Ensure a unique and descriptive <title> tag for each page using title best practices described in the lecture.
Semantic markup:
Use the <nav> tag to define a uniform "menu" on each page
Use the <article>, <header> and <footer> tags at a minimum, with other tags to be used as appropriate.
Submit your own raw HTML code â€“ evidence of code generation will result in a 0.
No styles, CSS, JavaScript, or other advanced components to the site.
